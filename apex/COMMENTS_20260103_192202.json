We went to the house at 23 Universal Place Unit 11 - Br Mooqseen was at home asked us to please wait outside whilst he changes. We met the brother at 13:09 - He invited us inside the home - offered us to sit on his couch which was occupied with clothes and various other items. I hamza asked him why has he not followed the plan of action to attend business classes, he alleges he took Rookaya to the hospital and she has a possible tumor in the head. Said we can wait for Rookaya as she left to pick up the kids. He realised we could ask why hasnt he picked up the kids considering the heat and said he doesnt pick up the due to his restraining order. The home was in a terrible state to say the least. Food was left open and exposed. I advised Br. Mooqseen its in the best interest of his family to keep a Hygiene home. Some Groceries that SANZAF through its donors were left on the cupboard. Soap Bars was on the Cupboard gathering dust. I advised the brother to please use the Soap to keep the home clean. I advised the Brother its important to keep the house paak for Salaah and Barakah in the home, The brother was clearly upset and the hard truth. This Brother has a habit of getting angry - The Truth is the Brother has the Tools to run his car wash business - Asked if he went out to wash cars he said no. it was visible from the way the house was kept that this Couple are very Lazy and make very little or no effort to keep a conducive home to raise their kids. Home Visit we left at 13:25pm.",

His contract ended and he had returned home.\r\n•\tHe has two wives that live separately.\r\n•\tHis first wife(2 children) is gainfully employed at African Bank and pays her own bills.\r\n•\tThe second wife(1 Child) is unemployed.\r\n•\tHis initial request was R4500 for electricity. It was approved and paid by SANZAF.(29/04/2022)\r\n•\tHe was also assisted with a grocery hamper & R500 worth of vouchers.\r\n•\tHe stated that he had applied for several jobs in Qatar and was awaiting feedback.\r\n•\tHis second request was R10 000 for rent and R1 038.24 for electricity for May 2022. \r\n•\tDr. Osman paid R10 000 via SANZAF once off(he wishes to remain anonymous). SANZAF paid R1038.24 for electricity – 16/05/2022. \r\n•\tHe was advised to bring his wife in for development/employment.\r\n•\tHe chose to join the business class. His request was for R57 000 to sell perfumes._\r\n•\tThe business committee only approved him for R5000 as he did not have any business premises or set customers.\r\n•\tHe made a profit of R1000 from the business._\r\n•\tHe then made a request for R40 000 for the business. He was requested to send a business report for two months of operation but he had spent the money on personal expenses. \r\n•\tHis business request was declined.\r\n•\tHe was advised to follow up with job opportunities. As per the development department his wife chose business over employment but dropped out of the business class. Br. Mohamed did not report back to development on any job applications._\r\n•\tIn the interim he moved from a cheaper flat to a more expensive flat as the landlord had sold the flat. This was done without consultation with SANZAF.\r\n•\tPlease note that during his business training, he was assisted with: _\r\n1.\tRent – June(R4000), July(R4000), August(R4000), September(R4000), October(R2000).\r\n2.\tGroceries – April, May, June, July, August, November.\r\n3.\tVouchers -  April(R500), May(R500), June(R500), August(R400), Solidarity voucher(R1000).\r\n•\tThe Shurra committee did not approve any further rental requests as they stated that he had not followed up on employment and had failed in his business. He is able bodied and needed to seek employment urgently as SANZAF gave him sufficient time and opportunities to empower himself.\r\n•\tHe stated that he doesn’t want to work in South Africa as per his caseworker and the development department.\r\n•\tWhen the caseworker contacted him to advise him that his last rental request was not approved, she encouraged him to return to SANZAF’s development department with respect to employment. \r\n•\tAs per the caseworker, Mohamed stated ‘Thank you so much for all the assistance he received from SANZAF’. (22/11/2022).\r\n•\tThat was the last that SANZAF heard from Mohamed.\r\nI hope that this report provides clarity with respect to the recipient, Mohamed Mtshali.\r\nShukran\r\nCassim",

They are finding it difficult to pay the rent. Her husband sells belts. HC contacted her family and her mother asked to come back home. This was initally the plan however, the next day things changed. Applicant requested for her husband to go back with her. TN made a recommendation for the young couple to stay and attend madressa as her husband accepted Islam when they got married, for him to work. Then TN asked for a second opinion, contacted Jamiat to interview guests. They agreed with TN recommendation. 1 month rental once off paid by us. Stock given to guests. Their POA was for them to both attend Madressa classes as Rumaanah Islamic knowledge is poor, for them to start working and earn. ONCE OFF assistance given to them.",

Previously, I did advise guest that he should consider staying at kickstart accommodation, or at a shelter as the beach is not safe. He got kicked out of his in laws house. Wife is currently living there with her daughter. Couple request is rental assistance for a new place. I advised them that they would need to look for a place. However, there was some concerns of no income, guest and his wife is both unemployed. I advised him that he should urgently seek a job or do something that would help sustain him and his family, because if Sanzaf (Shura committee) only approves one month rental, going forward how would they manage with no income. I even advised the couple that we are now moving from welfare and focusing more on development, and if there is any development they need, we are happy to assist as well. Brother Zaid Agreed with me, and he said he understands and it makes sense. I asked him if he has a CV he stated yes, I advised them to please send it to me as I would help him look for a job. I asked guest if they are ok with what I have stated and advise that I have given them, he stated yes. Guest one request to me was food for his wife, Hamper was given.",

The result was a fractured back, hip, torn thandorm in leg and right arm broken in two places. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI spent over two months in a government hospital in China. The expenses were high. I could not do the required surgery , as for example they required 60 000RMB to do the back operation. I had to return to South Africa for medical treatment. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy father promised to help with expenses in South Africa. I was trapped like a prisoner in the hospital in China. I could not leave until the hospital bill was paid. No help from my family , that is, my father, brother or sister. The medical insurance had to be paid in advance and then claim from the insurance. I did not have the money. Finally some miracles happened. An Egyptian Muslim group offered to help me pay for something towards the caregiver. I did not know them. The good Muslim brothers and sisters who were strangers came to my help, without requiring anything from me. They told me that it was a pleasure to assist me. Secondly a South African student in China came to know of my situation and contacted the South African Minister of foreign affairs. She applied pressure on the RSA ambasy and they applied pressure on the medical insurance which finally agreed to pay part of of hospital bill. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am in a wheelchair and can't walk as a result of nerve damage. I could start a little walking if I get some specialized treatment, but the government hospital in RSA does not want to give me this treatment. However they were going to do surgery on my arm and leg in December, which they has postponed for April. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Durban my sister refused to help in with accommodation. Moved from place to place with a caregiver like a homeless person. Finally got accommodation where the payment is 5000 a month for a studio room.I have run out of all my funds \r\n\r\nMy rent is now 4 months overdue. The caregiver salary is also owing. I have gone through periods of starvation without food. I am not able to work and have not worked for almost a year . My father that was going to assist me passed away after I came to South Africa. The above is a brief account of my situation. I need assistance soon, otherwise I will end up in the streets, where I will not be able to survive for long .\r\n\r\n  Thanks",
