SANZAF paid R1038.24 for electricity – 16/05/2022.   •	He was advised to bring his wife in for development/employment.  •	He chose to join the business class. His request was for R57 000 to sell perfumes._  •	The business committee only approved him for R5000 as he did not have any business premises or set customers.  •	He made a profit of R1000 from the business._  •	He then made a request for R40 000 for the business. He was requested to send a business report for two months of operation but he had spent the money on personal expenses.   •	His business request was declined.  •	He was advised to follow up with job opportunities. As per the development department his wife chose business over employment but dropped out of the business class. Br. Mohamed did not report back to development on any job applications._  •	In the interim he moved from a cheaper flat to a more expensive flat as the landlord had sold the flat. This was done without consultation with SANZAF.  •	Please note that during his business training, he was assisted with: _  1.	Rent – June(R4000), July(R4000), August(R4000), September(R4000), October(R2000).  2.	Groceries – April, May, June, July, August, November.  3.	Vouchers -  April(R500), May(R500), June(R500), August(R400), Solidarity voucher(R1000).  •	The Shurra committee did not approve any further rental requests as they stated that he had not followed up on employment and had failed in his business. He is able bodied and needed to seek employment urgently as SANZAF gave him sufficient time and opportunities to empower himself.  •	He stated that he doesn’t want to work in South Africa as per his caseworker and the development department.  •	When the caseworker contacted him to advise him that his last rental request was not approved, she encouraged him to return to SANZAF’s development department with respect to employment.   •	As per the caseworker, Mohamed stated ‘Thank you so much for all the assistance he received from SANZAF’.

I could not do the required surgery , as for example they required 60 000RMB to do the back operation. I had to return to South Africa for medical treatment.          My father promised to help with expenses in South Africa. I was trapped like a prisoner in the hospital in China. I could not leave until the hospital bill was paid. No help from my family , that is, my father, brother or sister. The medical insurance had to be paid in advance and then claim from the insurance. I did not have the money. Finally some miracles happened. An Egyptian Muslim group offered to help me pay for something towards the caregiver. I did not know them. The good Muslim brothers and sisters who were strangers came to my help, without requiring anything from me. They told me that it was a pleasure to assist me. Secondly a South African student in China came to know of my situation and contacted the South African Minister of foreign affairs. She applied pressure on the RSA ambasy and they applied pressure on the medical insurance which finally agreed to pay part of of hospital bill.          I am in a wheelchair and can''t walk as a result of nerve damage. I could start a little walking if I get some specialized treatment, but the government hospital in RSA does not want to give me this treatment.
